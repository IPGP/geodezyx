## Introduction

The purpose of _geodezyx_ (pronounced *geode-**zeecks***), also known as _the GeodeZYX toolbox_, is to provide all the functions which
can be useful for Geodesy and Geophysics. 

It includes low-level functions, file management functions,
time and space-coordinates conversion functions, 
data (especially GNSS observations and orbits) retrieve functions, 
plots and visual selection functions ...

It is designed for Python 3 on a LINUX Ubuntu-like system.
Also tested with Anaconda

## Documentation

See the following link:
[https://ipgp.github.io/geodezyx/](https://ipgp.github.io/geodezyx/)

## Installation 

See the following link:
[https://ipgp.github.io/geodezyx/getting_started.html#installation](https://ipgp.github.io/geodezyx/getting_started.html#installation)

## Installation (detailed legacy instructions)

### with PyPI and pip

We recommend using `pip` to do a proper installation.  
To get the latest working version, you can install directly the GitHub-hosted version (recommended):  

``pip install git+https://github.com/IPGP/geodezyx``

You can also install the version hosted on PyPI (but you will not get the latest changes)

``pip install geodezyx``

### clone and manually install from GitHub

You can manually fork and/or clone the GitHub repository
([https://github.com/IPGP/geodezyx/](https://github.com/IPGP/geodezyx/))
using your favorite flavor:
* SSH: ``git clone git@github.com:IPGP/geodezyx.git``
* https: ``git clone https://github.com/IPGP/geodezyx.git``

and install the Toolbox you downloaded with ``python setup.py install``

Alternatively, you can also add the ``geodezyx`` folder in your ``PYTHONPATH`` (for experimented users)

## Changelog

### v4.5.3, 2024-12-28
  * First version using CI/CD with GitHub Actions
  * Correct bug for mono-GNSS RINEX in `read_rnx2_obs` and `read_rnx3_obs`.
  * Correct python 3.12's annoying regex's raw string SyntaxWarning.
  * v4.5.2 is cancelled, because `requirements.txt` is too version-restrictive. 

### v4.5.1, 2024-11-28
  * Make `geodezyx` compatible with Python 3.12
  * Improvement of PRIDE-related execution functions
  * New leap second functions, to cope with new Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
  * `seawater` and `gsw` modules are installed in `full` mode & imported on demand only
  * Correct angle conversion functions
  * New version of `conv.numpydt2dt` function
  * Misc routine improvements
  * v4.5.0 is cancelled, because `requirements.txt` is missing

### v4.4.3, 2024-05-20
  * Speed execution optimization for orbit/clock-related functions
  * Misc routine improvements

### v4.4.2, 2024-04-17
  * The GitHub repository, and the project in general, has been renamed as ``geodezyx`` (in lower case)
    to uniformize its multiple spellings and then avoid confusion.
    * It must be transparent for your clones but updating them is recommended \
      https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository
  * misc routine improvements
  * Refactoring of the GNSS data/products dowmload functions

### v4.4.1, 2024-02-08
  * The GitHub repository has now been moved under the IPGP organization.
    * It must be transparent for your clones but updating them is recommended \
      https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository  
  * The version numbering goes without a starting zero from now on.  
    Initially, this first zero was kept as a "perpetual beta" marker,  
    but The GeodeZYX toolbox is a grown-up project now!
  * Bugs corrected for `read_rnx2_obs` and `OrbDF` manipulation functions.

### v0.4.4.0, 2023-11-24
  * The toolbox turns to the _GNU Lesser General Public License version 3_
  * Module docstring has been updated
  * Angle conversion functions have been refactored
  * sp3/clk DataFrame column names are renamed to better fit the data content:
    * `sat` > `prn`, `const` > `sys`, `sv` > `prni`, `AC` > `ac`
      
### v0.4.3.6, 2023-06-30
  * a routine version update (bug corrections...)
  * colors in the logger
  * NB: v0.4.3.5, v0.4.3.4 & v0.4.3.3 are cancelled releases

### v0.4.3.2, 2023-03-08
  * 1000th commit on GitHub ðŸ¥³
  * GitHub repository is renamed for simplification 
    * `GeodeZYX-Toolbox_v4` becomes `geodezyx-toolbox` (lowercase and without version)
    * It must be transparent for your clones but updating them is recommended \
      https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository  
  * beta for GROOPS automatized run functions
  * Dropbox download function
  * UTM coordinates conversion function (IGN algorithm) 
  * implementation of UTM coordinates in the TimeSeries class
  * logger improvement (shorter timestamps & message ranks)

### v0.4.3.1, 2022-12-09
  * Routine update: multiple new features/functions and bug corrections

### v0.4.3.0, 2022-02-10
  * enhanced logger replaces basic prints.
  * GeodeZYX is now "virtualenv-ready", i.e. stand-alone based on the ``setup.py`` required modules.
  * a ``full`` version is set, for advanced installation.
