## Introduction

The purpose of this GeodeZYX toolbox is to provide all the functions which
can be useful for Geodesy and Geophysics. 

It includes low level functions, file management functions,
time and space-coordinates conversion functions, 
data (especially GNSS observations and orbits) retrieve functions, 
plots and visual selection functions ...

It is designed for Python 3 on a LINUX Ubuntu-like system.
Also tested with Anaconda

## Installation 

See the following link:

## Installation (detailed legacy instructions)

### with PyPi and pip

We recommend to use pip to do a propper installation:
``pip install geodezyx``

To get the latest working version you can install directly the GitHub-hosted version:
``pip install -I -U git+https://github.com/GeodeZYX/GeodeZYX-Toolbox_v4``

### clone and manually install from GitHub

You can manually fork and clone the GitHub repository
[https://github.com/GeodeZYX/GeodeZYX-Toolbox_v4/](https://github.com/GeodeZYX/GeodeZYX-Toolbox_v4/)

and install the Toolbox you downloaded with ``python setup.py install``

Alternatively, you can also add the ``geodezyx`` forder in your ``PYTHONPATH`` (for experimented users)
