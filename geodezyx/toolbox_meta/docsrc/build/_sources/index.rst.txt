The purpose of this `GeodeZYX Toolbox` is to provide all the functions which can be useful for Geodesy and Geophysics.

It includes low level functions, file management functions, time and space-coordinates conversion functions, data (especially GNSS observations and orbits) retrieve functions, plots and visual selection functions ...

It is designed for Python 3 on a LINUX Ubuntu-like system. Also tested with Anaconda
