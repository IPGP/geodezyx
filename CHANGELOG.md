## Changelog

### v5.0.0, 2025-07-10
**Breaking changes**:
  * (Much) faster import. The main `geodezyx` doesn't import all modules per default anymore. Thus, favor the following import methods:
    * `from geodezyx import <module>`
    * `import geodezyx.<module>`
  * We recommend `gzyx_<module>` as import alias, e.g.:
    * `from geodezyx import files_rw as gzyx_files_rw`
    * `import geodezyx.files_rw as gzyx_files_rw`
  * Two exceptions: widely-used `conv` and `utils` submodules remain loaded by the main `geodezyx` module.   
    Thus, `import geodezyx` will only load `conv` and `utils` modules.
  * NB: `from geodezyx import *` still load __all modules__. But its use is __highly discouraged__ (very slow).
  * PEP8 compliance: `conv` module functions are now PEP8 compliant, e.g. upper case function names are now lower case.
    * Exemples:
      * `dt2MJD` > `dt2_mjd`, `MJD2dt` > `mjd2_dt`
      * `XYZ2ENU` > `xyz2enu`, `GEO2XYZ` > `geo2xyz`
    * Deprecated functions are still available with a warning, but will be removed in the future.
  
  * Lot of minor imporvements and bug corrections

### v4.6.0, 2025-02-04
  * Faster RINEX3 reading (~ x5)
  * Frontend `read_rinex_obs` fonction

  * Correct python 3.12's annoying regex's raw string SyntaxWarning.
  * v4.5.2 is cancelled, because `requirements.txt` is too version-restrictive.

  * Make `geodezyx` compatible with Python 3.12
  * Improvement of PRIDE-related execution functions
  * New leap second functions, to cope with new Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
  * `seawater` and `gsw` modules are installed in `full` mode & imported on demand only
  * Correct angle conversion functions
  * New version of `conv.numpydt2dt` function
  * Misc routine improvements
  * v4.5.0 is cancelled, because `requirements.txt` is missing

### v4.4.3, 2024-05-20
  * Speed execution optimization for orbit/clock-related functions
  * Misc routine improvements

### v4.4.2, 2024-04-17
  * The GitHub repository, and the project in general, has been renamed as ``geodezyx`` (in lower case)
    to uniformize its multiple spellings and then avoid confusion.
    * It must be transparent for your clones but updating them is recommended \
      https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository
  * misc routine improvements
  * Refactoring of the GNSS data/products dowmload functions

### v4.4.1, 2024-02-08
  * The GitHub repository has now been moved under the IPGP organization.
    * It must be transparent for your clones but updating them is recommended \
      https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository  
  * The version numbering goes without a starting zero from now on.  
    Initially, this first zero was kept as a "perpetual beta" marker,  
    but The GeodeZYX toolbox is a grown-up project now!
  * Bugs corrected for `read_rnx2_obs` and `OrbDF` manipulation functions.

### v0.4.4.0, 2023-11-24
  * The toolbox turns to the _GNU Lesser General Public License version 3_
  * Module docstring has been updated
  * Angle conversion functions have been refactored
  * sp3/clk DataFrame column names are renamed to better fit the data content:
    * `sat` > `prn`, `const` > `sys`, `sv` > `prni`, `AC` > `ac`
      
### v0.4.3.6, 2023-06-30

  * beta for GROOPS automatized run functions
  * Dropbox download function
  * UTM coordinates conversion function (IGN algorithm)
